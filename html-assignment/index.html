        <p>
            My name is Aldana. I am from Argentina. I lived in the capital city, but I moved with my boyfriend to Ottawa last July. 
            I have been studying Multimedia Art for three years, yet I did not finish it because I preferred to study English. 
            Because the <em>MUTEK festival</em> is presented in Argentina, I knew  it was taking place in Montreal, Canada. Thus, I decided to study interactive media design in Canada.

            In addition, I had the possibility to work for <abbr title="General Motors CO.">GMC</abbr> and Ford as a content editor. 
            I have learnt about XML coding, Photoshop, and business platforms. These international publicity agencies gave me the opportunity to grow professionally. However, I wanted to finish Multimedia Art in order to have more opportunities to work in other fields.
